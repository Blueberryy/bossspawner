# Bossspawner

This plugin runs on Sourcemod for the game Team Fortress 2

On TF2, there are 4 different types of bosses that can be spawned.
This plugin allows you to created your own boss, allowing you the server owner to set the healthpoints, damage, size, etc.

From there, you can spawn the created boss by user command/auto-respawn (if position is set for map).
Auto-respawn is a great tool and a fun mod to use on servers as it allows players on the server to have boss fights.
The auto-respawn can be random/numerically/voted to choose the next boss to be spawned.

This plugin allows you to set the custom bosses:
- Heath base
- Health scale
- Lifetime
- Model
- Weapon model
- Hat model
- Hat size
- Hat position
- Damage
- Size
- Glow	("R G B A") which is between 0-255 that indicates the color of glow, "0 0 0 0" if off, "255 0 0 255" is red, "0 255 0 255" is green, "0 0 255 255" is blue and so on...google RGB values if you want other colors 
- Position
- Horde (For multi spawns)
- Color (Change color for the skeletons, CAN NOT HAVE CUSTOM MODEL OVER)
- Gnome (Enable/Disable whether the gnomes from skeletons are spawned when the skeleton dies)
- PosFix (Some custom models may make the boss spawn under, increase posfix to spawn it higher)
- IntroSound
- DeathSound
