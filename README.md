# Bossspawner

This plugin runs on Sourcemod for the game Team Fortress 2

On TF2, there are 4 different types of bosses that can be spawned.
This plugin allows you to created your own boss, allowing you the server owner to set the healthpoints, damage, size, etc.

From there, you can spawn the created boss by user command/auto-respawn (if position is set for map).
Auto-respawn is a great tool and a fun mod to use on servers as it allows players on the server to have boss fights.
The auto-respawn can be random/numerically/voted to choose the next boss to be spawned.

This plugin allows you to set the custom bosses:
- Heath base
- Health scale
- Lifetime
- Model
- Weapon model
- Hat model
- Hat size
- Hat position
- Damage
- Size
- Glow
- Position
- Horde (For multi spawns)
- Color
- Gnome
- PosFix
- IntroSound
- DeathSound
